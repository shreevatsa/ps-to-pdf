# PostScript to PDF in the browser

This is a tool for converting PostScript (`.ps` or `.ps.gz`) files to PDF entirely in the browser.

Serving at {TODO: url here}.

My preferred way when not on a phone is to use [this browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/postscript-viewer/ebpiondkhkldijolgmhfenknngkkjola) ([GitHub](https://github.com/ochachacha/ps-wasm)), but this tool is for other times, or others who don't have it installed.

Mostly written by Claude (Sonnet 4.5) and then by ChatGPT (GPT-5 Thinking). Uses Ghostscript compiled to WebAssembly, from [this repo](https://github.com/laurentmmeyer/ghostscript-pdf-compress.wasm).

TODO: Tested on {Chrome, Firefox} on {macOS, Android}, and Safari on macOS. Not tested on iPhones.

## Quick Start

Visit <url> and use it.

Alternatively, put these three files:

- gs.js
- gs.wasm
- index.html

and start a server, for example

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then open in browser: http://localhost:8000/index.html
```

## How It Works

1. User uploads PostScript file or provides URL
2. File is loaded into browser (stays local)
3. Ghostscript WebAssembly converts PS â†’ PDF
4. PDF is displayed in browser and can be downloaded

The ~14MB `gs.wasm` file is downloaded once and cached by your browser.

## Customization

### Modify Ghostscript Options

In the JavaScript, find the `arguments` array:

```javascript
arguments: [
    '-sDEVICE=pdfwrite',
    '-dNOPAUSE',
    '-dBATCH',
    '-dSAFER',
    '-dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress',  // Quality: /screen, /ebook, /printer, /prepress
    '-dEmbedAllFonts=true',      // Embed all fonts
    '-sOutputFile=output.pdf',
    'input.ps'
]
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Failed to load Ghostscript"**
- Make sure `gs.js` and `gs.wasm` are in the same directory as the HTML (Run `setup.sh` if they are missing.)
- Use a web server, not `file://`

## License

**AGPL-3.0** (same as Ghostscript)

See [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

## Privacy

All processing happens in your browser. Your files never leave your device. The converter:
- Doesn't upload files to any server
- Doesn't require an internet connection (after initial load of the HTML, JS and WASM files)
